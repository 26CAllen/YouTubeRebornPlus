# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ This version is made for iOS 12 user. Get the IPA in the [Download section](#download-ipa) ⚠️⚠️⚠️
### ☞ _Expected bugs because I cannot test the IPA my self!_
### ☞ _YTUHD is removed because most iOS 12 devices don't support VP9 codec (Hardware restriction)._
### ☞ _iOS 12 doesn't have the built-in Picture in Picture mode like iOS 14+, so YouPiP must be removed as well._

# Features

1. **Cercube:**

- Block all advertisements & Enable background playback.

- Set default player quality on WiFi & Celullar.

- Save videos in high resolution, save videos as audio-only, save public playlists (beta).

- And many more...

2. **iSponsorBlock:** Skips annoying sponsor ads inside videos. iSponsorBlock is based on [SponsorBlock engine](https://sponsor.ajay.app/). Basically, this is the iOS version of the SponsorBlock extension.

3. **YouPiP:** enable YouTube's **native PiP**. More options are in YouTube Settings => General.

4. **YouTube Dislike Return:** brings back Dislike counts under YouTube videos using **ReturnYoutubeDislike**'s API.

5. **YTClassicVideoQuality:** since YouTube v16.xx, you need one more step to change the video quality. YTClassicVideoQuality brings back the old video quality selector, which is a lot better than the new one.

6. **YTNoHoverCards:** offer an option to enable/disable the annoying suggested videos show up at the end of the videos.

7. **YTABGoodies:** allow you to disable some YouTube A/B testing features. It is a combination of several tweaks, such as:

- YouAreThere: disable "Video paused. Continue watching?" popup in the YouTube app when you play a long video.

- YouRememberCaption: make YouTube remember your video caption setting (if not already).

- YTNoCheckLocalNetwork: block the Local Network permission popup.

8. **NOYTPremium:** remove YouTube Premium upsell alerts.

# Known issues

1. **Cercube**: Hide Cast button is not working.

2. **YouPiP** (iOS 14.0 - 14.4.2): due to Apple's fault, you may encounter the *speedup-bug* as described [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKdv1fr_KRWgD8nhkMDfG2eLBnbdeVtX/view?usp=sharing). The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable **LegacyPiP** is a workaround. Keep in mind that LegacyPiP also removes UHD quality and breaks YouTube Autoplay next. Use it at your own risk!

3. **Not a bug**: 

- The app won't be able to receive push notifications if you use a free developer account to sideload it. 

- It's impossible to fix deep-link (a.k.a Open in the YouTube app). However, you can use this [Shortcuts](https://shortcutsgallery.com/shortcuts/open-in-youtube/) as a workaround (tested on iOS 14). **Credit:** RandomAccessMemories#5025
